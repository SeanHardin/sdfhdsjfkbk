render a table?
design architecture

understand webGL (merge projects) eh.....


start working on design doc
start working on test doc

update project management plan and SRS
11/14 tech talk, know how webgl draws by then.

drag cards within the canvas, snap in place, draw from deck yourself?
cards aren't defined until server acknowledges that a player should be drawing it.
FOR NOW, let cards just pop in.
