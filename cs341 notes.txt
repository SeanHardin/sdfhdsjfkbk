show sites used when i looked online to find something i needed.

"lo" from login was the very first message sent on the internet. (it crashed before it was finished typing)

hosts = end systems
communication links - fiber, copper, radio, satellite
transmission rate - bandwidth
packet switches - forward packets (chunks of data) through routers and switches.

interconnected network of networks    shortened to internet.
protocols - control sending and receiving of messages (TCP, IP, HTTP, Skype, 802.11)
internet standards - RFC (request for comments), IETF (internet engineering task force)

protocol - define format, order of mssages sent and received among network entities, and actions taken on mesage transmission receipt.

network edge - essentially the 2 hosts communicating at a given time.
network core - all the routers connecting the hosts.

connect end systems to edge router - residential access not, institutional access network, mobile access networks
 consider bandwidth, shared or dedicated?

cabel modem termination system single connect to larger network, branches for end users.
HFC hybrid fiber coax - asymmetric up to 30 Mbps downstream transmission rate 2 Mbps upstream
network of cable, fiber attaches home to isp, homes share access network to cable headend

DHCP - ip is given by the host institution
NETWORKS USE BITS, HARD DRIVE USES BYTES.

packets have ip header and ip footer, then a TCP header and footer, next layer has HTTP header, next layer has post

radio link types
 terrestrial microwave - point at each other and transfer data through air.

routing - determines source destination route taken by packets IDENTIFY
forwarding - move the packes from router's input to appropriate router output. PHYSICAL

circuit switching

encapsulation - must first peel from the most recently added, adds top one first.
**internet protocol stack:**************
 application - enables user to access the network and connect to other hosts - FTP, SMTP, HTTP
 transport - transfer data onto network - TCP, UDP - ensure ordering, guaranteed delivery
 network - finding optimal route for packets and sending them - IP, routing protocols
 link - links directly with next switch along path - ethernet, 802.11 (wifi), PPP.
 physical - moves actual bits to switch found by link

transmission control protocol - guarantees that a packet can get to destination in order.
LAYERING PROTOCOLS IS IMPORTANT, MODULARIZED SUCH THAT OTHERS CAN FOCUS ON THEIR OWN THING.

**ISO/OSI reference model: ******************
 presentation - allow app to interpret meaning of data, if encrypted/compressed/machine specific
 session - synchronizes end systems and creates checkpoints for quickly recovering connection or transmission if dropped connection


packet queue in router buffers - loss if queue is overloaded, 
delay when packets need to get through queues. - time waiting at output link for transmission, depends on congestion
delay from processing - checking bit errors, determine output link, typically < msec
delay from transmitting data to next routing - d = packet length/link bandwidth
delay from propogating message through to next router. -  = length of physical link/propagation speed

ip does not guarantee order
internet trace route - traceroute program - provides delay measurements from source to router along internet path towards destination
 sends 3 packets that will reach destination
tracert europa.eu - command to get traceroute to destination, shows each router passed through.

every computer has an ip, but not every computer has a name. DNS turns a name into its respective ip address for browsers.(domain name service)

networking card can be set to promiscuous mode which reads all records sent through a hub system.


APPLICATION LAYER - 

sockets - a way for C programs to communicate over the internet. will use Java sockets for class

client server - always on host, permanent IP address, data centers for scaling
 clients - communicate with server, may e intermittently connected, may have dynamic IP, do not communicate directly with each other

p2p architecture - no always on server
 arbitrary end systems directly communicate
 peers request service from other peers, self scalability - new peers bring new service capacity, as well as new service demands
 peers are intermittently connected and change IP addresses - complex management.

processes communicating - 
 process - program running within a host, within a host, 2 processes communicate using inter-process communication
  processes in different hosts communicate by exchanging messages
 client process - initiates communication       server process - waits to be contacted
 aside - applications with p2p architectures have client processes and server processes

sockets - process sends/receives messages to/from its socket
 analogous to a door - sending process shoves message out, sending process relies on transport infrastructure on other side to deliver
  message to socket at receiving process.
 computers listen on a port which is a positive integer. port can only take single thing per port
  HTTP generally listens on port 80  SMTP 21  HTTPS 443
  computers have a lot of ports 65535?

addressing processes - need an identifier to receive messages
 host device has unique 32 bit IP,    identifier includes both ip address and port numbers associated with process on host
 
app layer protocol defines
 types of messages exchanged - request, response
 message syntax - fields an delineation
 message semantics - meaning of information in fields
 rules - for when and how processes send and respond to messages
 open protocols - defines in RFCs, allows for interoperability (HTTP, SMTP)     proprietary protocols (Skype)

transport service - 
 data integrity - some apps require 100% reliable transfer (file transfer, web transactions), others can tolerate loss (audio)
 timing - some apps require low delay to be effective (internet, phone, interactive games)
 throughput - some require minimum amount of throughput to be effective (multimedia) others make do
 security - encryption, data integrity.

nslookup <website name? to get their ip address
can add :<port> to connect to specific ports ie https://www.google.com:217

data loss   throughput    time sensitive   application
no	    elastic       no		   file transfer
email
web documents
loss tolerant audio 5-1kMbps video 10-5k   yes 100's msec

internet transport protocols services
 TCP 
  reliable transport between sending and receiving process
  flow control - sender wont overwhelm receiver
  congestion control - throttle sender when network overloaded
  does not provide timing, minimum throughput guarantee, security
  connection oriented - setup required between client and server process
 UDP
  unreliable data transfer between sending and receiving process
  does not provide reliability, flow control, congestion control, timing, throughput guarantee, security, or connection setup
  very fast.

there aint no such thing as a free lunch TANSTAAFL

securing TCP - 
TCP and UDP - no encryption, cleartext passwords sent int socket traverse internet in cleartext
SSL - secure sockets layer - provides encrypted TCP connection, data integrity, end point authentication
 apps use SSL libraries that 'talk' to TCP
 cleartext passwords sent into socket traverse internet encrypted

**what internet layer does SSL correspond to? application layer.********************************
 
web and HTTP - web page consists of objects, which can be HTML file, JPEG, Java applet, audio file...
 page has base HTML file which includes several referenced objects, each addressable by a URL
url - uniform resource locator
path name is the stuff after the first slash
query stream is the stuff after the ?

HTTP - hypertext transfer protocol
 eb's application layer protocol, client server model - client is browser that requrests, receives and displays web objects
 server - web server sends objects in response to requests

HTTP connections - 
 non persistent - at most one object sent over TCP connection, conection is closed, multiple objects required multiple connections
  requires to RTTs per object, 
 persistent - multiple objects can be sent over single TCP connection between client, server.
  more efficient...

upload form input
 post - web page includes form input, input uploaded to server in entity body
 url - uses get method, input is uploaded in url

method types
 HTTP 
  GET
  POST
  HEAD - request server to leave requested object out of response
 HTTP 1.1
  GET,POST,HEAD
  PUT - uploads file to specified path
  DELETE

HTTP Codes
 200 - ok
 301 - moved permanently
 400 - bad request - message not understood by server
 404 - item not found
 501

SMTP, POP3, IMAP know the differences, generally what they do.


o Be able to explain / define the following terms/acronyms:
 o Internet (including structure such as Global / Regional ISPs and IXP)
     collection of computers all connected through routers that belong to ISPs/other users. IXP is international router between ISPs
 o Protocol (including the purposes / acronym for protocols we discussed like HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, etc.)
     set of instructions to send a message to another host system
 o DNS, TLD - domain name system, top level domains
     DNS translates web addresses into IP address to connect, Top level domain system does so for top level domains
 o Throughput
     rate at which bits are transferred between sender and receiever
 o SSL - secure socket layer
     part of the application layer, encrypts data and sends it through TCP to secure data
 o DDoS - distributed denial of service
     an attack using computers in a botnet to take down servers from too much traffic
 o TCP/UDP -  transport control protocol, user datagram protocol,guarantees order
     transport protocols
 o Cookies
     tiny bits of information websites use to store information about user
o Fully understand Chapter 1 slide 38 on Internet structure
 o Be able to answer the question: why doesn’t every network just connect to every other network directly? (Chapter 1 slide 34) 
     that would take absurd resources to connect across the world multiple times over
o Packet Switching/Routing
    store and forward - queue up, send full packets at a time, routed based on preset destinations
o Understand the 4 sources of packet delays (Chapter 1 slide 45)
    processing - check bit errors, determine output link
    queueing - time waiting to get through queue
    transmission - time spent being transmitted (packet size/transmission speed(also called bandwidth))
    propagation - travel time (length of wire/travel speed)
o How does packet data loss occur (Chapter 1 slide 43)
    overflow of queue
o Protocol layers
 o ISO protocol layers -  international standardization organization
     Presentation - allow app to interpret what data being received is (encrypted, zipped etc)
     Session - synchronizes end systems and creates checkpoints for quick recovery if connection drops
 o Internet protocol layers (including what protocol(s) correspond to what layer)
     application - enables application to access the network and connect to other hosts FTP, SMTP, HTTP
     transport - transfers data onto network TCP, UDP
     network - finds optimal route for packets IP
     link - links directly with next router in route Ethernet, Wifi, PPP
     physical - moves actual bits to switch found by link
 o What layers are missing from the Internet protocol layers relative to the ISO protocol layers, and what that means
     presentation, session. they aren't needed for most things, and only are included in applications that do need them.
 o How does SSL fit in to the layers
    application?
o Packet sniffing
    some hosts set up computer to watch internet requests on same network and can steal data that way
o IP address spoofing
    send packet with false source address, to make server talk to that address
o Client / Server vs. P2P architectures
    client server - always on, permanent ip address, need data centers to scale up
    p2p - users connect with each other..
o IP addresses & Ports – what are ports used for? Why do we need them?
    ports send and receive information, but can only handle listening for one thing at a time, so we need to use many to connect to others..
    clients find a port and connect to it to hear messages
    sockets are an API to allow app devs to use ports more easily.
o TCP vs. UDP – explain the uses, differences, strengths, weaknesses... why do even have UDP?
    TCP - guarantee transmission, controls flow and congestion, but no throughput, timing or security, needs connection
    UDP - throws everything else to the wayside to maximize speed for sound and video which loss is tolerable.
o How does HTTP work? (http is stateless) - hypertext transfer protocol
    client initiates TCP connection, server accepts, client sends hypertext over, connection gets closed
 o status codes
     200 - ok
     301 - moved permanently
     400 - bad request
     404 - not found
     505 - HTTP version not supported
 o Please understand the header and its general structure (Chapter 2 slide 28)
     header contains information about the connection being made, like browser version, character set, how long to keep connection, etc
     structure is a series of lines under the request line in http request. in format Accept-Language: en-us, en; \r\n
     an additional \r\n is required on the final line to end the header lines
 o Understand the different methods / verbs: HEAD, POST, GET and what they are used for
     Get - gets the page
     Post - sends request
     Head - Get http header. used to check if it has been updated from before.
 o Persistent vs. Non-persistent
     persistent - multiple objects can be sent over a single connection
     non-persistent - at most one object is sent over the TCP connection, multiple objects requires connecting multiple times
 o Cookies and session state - conceptually, how would you implement state using a cookie?
     cookies hold information about the user's id, which the server uses to take their state from their database.
o Email
 o how does SMTP work? (Chapter 2 slide 48) - simple mail transfer protocol
     send mail...   emails get sent to their local mail server, which forms TCP connection with destination's mail server, sends, that server delivers it
     to the destination user.
 o What does IMAP do? - internet message access protocol
     retrive mail   keeps all messages in a server that users can organize into folders.

imposter syndrome - feeling like you don't belong in the environment you have reached.

hw - book questions, build http header to retrieve web pages with.
     java SocketGet httpRESTOFPAGE
     telnet gaia.cs.umass.edu 80

DNS - hostname to ip address translation, not a single server to avoid having a single point of failure
 a distributed, hierarchical database, query root server for com, DNS server for amazon, something something
 TLD maintains servers for .com
 authoritative DNS server - organization's own DNS servers
records, 2 types of DNS resolutions********************************************************************


DNS poisoning - sending bogus replies and making them cache that.

java server - runs server
 telnet 127.0.0.1 8080 - connect to port 8080 of host computer.
 hello class - sends message to server, server copies it and prints it, then closes connection.


rdt 3.0 - send packet, wait, if timeout resend

PIPELINING.***************************************************
port numbers are unsigned 16 bit
sequence numbers are 32 bits...
