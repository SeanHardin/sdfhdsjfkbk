show sites used when i looked online to find something i needed.

"lo" from login was the very first message sent on the internet. (it crashed before it was finished typing)

hosts = end systems
communication links - fiber, copper, radio, satellite
transmission rate - bandwidth
packet switches - forward packets (chunks of data) through routers and switches.

interconnected network of networks    shortened to internet.
protocols - control sending and receiving of messages (TCP, IP, HTTP, Skype, 802.11)
internet standards - RFC (request for comments), IETF (internet engineering task force)

protocol - define format, order of mssages sent and received among network entities, and actions taken on mesage transmission receipt.

network edge - essentially the 2 hosts communicating at a given time.
network core - all the routers connecting the hosts.

connect end systems to edge router - residential access not, institutional access network, mobile access networks
 consider bandwidth, shared or dedicated?

cabel modem termination system single connect to larger network, branches for end users.
HFC hybrid fiber coax - asymmetric up to 30 Mbps downstream transmission rate 2 Mbps upstream
network of cable, fiber attaches home to isp, homes share access network to cable headend

DHCP - ip is given by the host institution
NETWORKS USE BITS, HARD DRIVE USES BYTES.

packets have ip header and ip footer, then a TCP header and footer, next layer has HTTP header, next layer has post

radio link types
 terrestrial microwave - point at each other and transfer data through air.

routing - determines source destination route taken by packets IDENTIFY
forwarding - move the packes from router's input to appropriate router output. PHYSICAL

circuit switching

internet protocol stack:**************
 application - supporting network applications - FTP, SMTP, HTTP
 transport - process-process data transfer - TCP, UDP
 network - routing of datagrams from source to destination - IP, routing protocols
 link - data ransfer between neighboring nework elements - ethernet, 802.11 (wifi), PPP. (physical - bits (on the wire)

transmission control protocol - guarantees that a packet can get to destination in order.
LAYERING PROTOCOLS IS IMPORTANT, MODULARIZED SUCH THAT OTHERS CAN FOCUS ON THEIR OWN THING.

ISO/OSI reference model: ******************
 presentation - allow app to interpret meaning of data, encryption, compression, machine specific conventions
 session - synchronization, checkpointing*********MISSING****
